The analysis from the provided text indicates that the spending ranges do not directly correlate with the overall pass percentage of students. Smaller to medium-sized schools outperform large schools in achieving overall passing percentages. The top five performing schools are all charter schools. 
To improve school performance, increasing the per-student budget may not guarantee improvements; instead, directing the budget towards appropriate resources could enhance overall performance. 
Additionally, reducing the size of large schools may yield better outcomes, and implementing successful practices from charter schools into district schools could lead to improvements in overall passing rates.
